# social-pathfinder
Graph-based tool for exploring connection paths and proximity between people in social networks using graph traversal techniques.

## Project Goals
The aim of this project is to:
- Experiment with representing social networks as graphs
- Explore pathfinding approaches (BFS, shorted path, weighted traversal)
- Build a small extensible foundation for future features
- Keep implementation simple and modular

## Features
- [ ] Graph-based social network model
- [ ] Demo network construction
- [ ] Shorted path / degrees of seperation queries
- [ ] Weighted traversal (popularity / influence)
- [ ] Graph visualization
- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] API interface

## Stack
- Python
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
